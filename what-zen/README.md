## Overview
What Zen is a task manager app which combines the functionality of a minimalist Agile board integrated with a chat feature designed to empower its users. Now users can directly contribute in the decision making process for all the tasks in their board in real-time.

What Zen is a production of Team What Zen - 
* David Mears
* Dan Groze
* Adrien Fabre
* Sherif Shendidy
* Diptis Halder

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

```

change down into the what-zen folder within the new what-zen-app folder and install dependencies:
```
cd what-zen-app
cd what-zen
npm install
```

If you want to run a local server, find the environment variables in the slack channel and store them in a .env file at the level of what-zen.

### `npm start`

### `yarn cypress:open`
